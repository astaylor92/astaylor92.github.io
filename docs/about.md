I've always loved the translation of real-world problems into solvable formulations. It started when I had to make MATLAB
[sing a song]("https://youtu.be/HG35mFxPuzU") in undergrad, and it continued during my seven-year career as a consultant at Kurt Salmon, a part of Accenture, 
where I became known as the 'data guy' in my practice. 

During my time delivering recommendations to retailers, I loved the end-to-end modeling process so much that I led our internal team for training and standardization! I authored guidelines to translate business needs to requirements, design solutions, collect and clean data, and develop models. These models and tools were sometimes used by our teams to come up with recommendations, and other times they were transitioned for ongoing use by retailers' teams.

Over the summer of 2022, I had the chance to work with an excellent data science team at Kabbage, and developed an understanding of modeling and project management processes at a company where machine learning was at the foundation of their product. 

In the future, I hope to bring my experience and enthusiasm to a team of data scientists. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech, looking for full-time work in January 2023.
