I've always loved the translation of real-world problems into solvable formulations. It started when I had to make MATLAB
[sing a song]("https://youtu.be/HG35mFxPuzU") in undergrad, and it continued during my seven-year career as a consultant at Kurt Salmon, a part of Accenture, 
where I became known as the 'data guy' in my practice. 

During my time delivering operational and strategic recommendations to retailers, I learned how to translate business needs to requirements, prescribe solutions to fit those needs, and develop the models and tools that answered those questions. These tools were sometimes used by our teams to come up with recommendations, and other times developed for in-house use by retailers' analytics teams.

In the future, I hope to bring the same passion and creativity to a team of data scientists. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech, looking for full-time work in January 2023.
