Since I took a CS course my freshman year at Georgia Tech where we figured out how to get MATLAB to
[sing us a song]("https://youtu.be/HG35mFxPuzU"), I've loved solving real-world problems with math.
After college, I worked for seven years as an Analyst through Senior Manager at Kurt Salmon, a part of Accenture, 
where I became known as the 'data guy' in my practice. Making computers sing evolved into developing models 
and analytics solutions in the retail space. During my time as a consultant, I learned how to translate business needs to requirements, prescribe solutions to fit those needs, and develop the models and tools that answer those questions. 

In the past, my work consisted of providing data-driven recommendations and developing in-house analytical tools for retailers. In the future, I hope to bring the same passion and creativity to a team of data scientists. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech, looking for full-time work in January 2023.
