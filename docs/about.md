### Hey! I'm Andrew.

Ever since starting my career as a retail strategy consultant known as the 'data guy' in our practice, I've enjoyed the intersection of analytics ("math") and business ("work"). I also like some other stuff ("stuff").

Translating business needs to requirements, prescribing analytics and data science solutions to fit those needs, then building effective, sophisticated models and tools that answer those questions is my passion. In the past, this has included various, typically supply chain-related, projects for retailers. In the future, I hope to bring the same passion to a team of data scientists. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech, looking for full-time work in January 2023.
