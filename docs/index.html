    Hi, I'm Andrew, and I like making things with math.

<p>
    Ever since I took a MATLAB course my freshman year at Georgia Tech, I've loved solving real-world problems with math.
    At the time, it was simply figuring out how to get MATLAB to <a href="https://youtu.be/HG35mFxPuzU">sing us a song</a>. 
    After college,  I worked for seven years as an Analyst through Senior Manager at Kurt Salmon, a part of Accenture, 
    where I became known as the 'data guy' in my practice. Making computers sing morphed into developing various models 
    and analytics solutions in the retail space.

    I recently went on leave to go back to Georgia Tech, where I'm wrapping up classes for my Masters in Analytics in December 
    2022, looking for full-time data science work in January 2023.
