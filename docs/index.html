    Since I took a CS course my freshman year at Georgia Tech where we figured out how to get MATLAB to

    After college, I worked for seven years as an Analyst through Senior Manager at Kurt Salmon, a part of Accenture, 
    where I became known as the 'data guy' in my practice. Making computers sing evolved into developing models 
    and analytics solutions in the retail space.

    I recently went on leave to go back to Georgia Tech, where I'm wrapping up classes for my Masters in Analytics in December 
    2022, looking for full-time data science work in January 2023.
