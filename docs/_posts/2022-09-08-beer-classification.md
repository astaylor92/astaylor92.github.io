# TODO FILL IN ALL "XX"s

# What I Did

## Context

This one was just for fun! I was poking around at beer data and came across a pretty clean dataset on Kaggle with characteristics of beer tastes, along with the beer source information (name, type, brewery). It got me wondering, how easy is it to mathematically tell different beer types apart?

For those that drink beer, some types are very clearly different (an IPA vs a light lager, for example), and others are not (like a porter and a stout). However, with this dataset providing XX different features, maybe we can classify beers pretty well!

## Objective

The goal was simply to train a multiclass classifier to predict a beer's style from its characteristics. 

Selfishly, I also hadn't used `scikit-learn`'s `Pipeline` object too much yet, and I also wanted to dive deeper into multiclass classification scoring and metrics, since most of my experience dealt with the binary case.

## Approach

I took a fairly standard approach to this problem, going through the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Transformation**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
4. **Model Selection**
5. **Final Model Tuning**
6. **Output Analysis**

### Data Collection

This was fairly straightforward. The data came from Kaggle at XX,
